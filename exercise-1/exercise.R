# Exercise 1: writing and executing functions

# Write a function `AddThree` that adds 3 to an input value

addthree <- function(a)
 { answer <- a+3
  return(answer)}

ten <- addthree(7)

feetToMeters <- function(a){
  answer <- a/3.28
  return(answer)}

# Create a variable `ten` by passing 7 to your `AddThree` function


# Write a function `FeetToMeters` that converts from feet to meters


# Create a variable `height.in.feet` that is your height in feet


fee# Create a variable `height.in.meters` by passing `height.in.feet` to your `FeetToMeters` function
